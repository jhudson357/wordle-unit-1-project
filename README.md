# Wordle
*Play the [Wordle](https://james-hudson-wordle.netlify.app/) game*

## About
This is my Unit 1 project created at General Assembly

## Game Rules
Guess the hidden word in 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. After submitting your guess, the tiles will change to green, yellow, or gray. 
- Green: The letter is in the correct spot
- Yellow: The letter is in the word, but in the wrong spot
- Gray: The letter is not in the word
